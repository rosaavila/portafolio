                <h1>Data Governance Development</h1>
                <p>
                    Data management solutions on their own are becoming very expensive
                    and not able to cope with the reality of everlasting data complexity.
                    Businesses have grown more sophisticated in their use of data, which
                    drives new demands that require different ways to handle this data.
                    Forward-thinking organizations believe that the only way to solve the data
                    problem will be the implementation of an effective data governance.
                    Attempts in governing data failed before, as they were driven by IT,
                    and affected by rigid processes and fragmented activities carried out
                    on system by system basis. Up to very recently governance is mostly informal with
                    very ambiguous and generic regulations, in siloes around specific enterprise repositories,
                    lacking structure and the wider support of the organization.
                    Despite its highly recognized importance,
                    the area of data governance is still under developed and under researched.
                    Since data governance is still under researched, there is need to advance
                    research in data governance in order to deepen practice.

                <h2>What is SQL programming for?</h2>
                <p>
                    SQL programming can be used to share and manage data, particularly table-organized
                    information found in relational database management systems. By using SQL, you can:
                    Consult, update and reorganize data. Create and modify the structure of a database system.
                    Control access to your data. Although it may seem somewhat similar to how a spreadsheet works,
                    the purpose of SQL is different, as it allows you to compile and manage data in much
                    larger volumes. While spreadsheets can get cluttered with too much information
                    filling too many cells, SQL databases allow you to handle up to billions of cells of data..
